 # Recommendations for further analysis
- We should collect data on where the best locations to surf are. It is important to place the shop the safe and popular areas.
- We should collect data on the number of tourists arrivals in O'ahu in different months as well as where the most rented hotels, so we can place the shop near to these locations.
- We should collect data on how many customers would like to buy or rent the surfing supply. It will help to make the business strategies.
